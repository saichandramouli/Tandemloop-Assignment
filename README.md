Programming language used- Python.
"""
Program-1: Calculator (Python)

# Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division using a class.
# Takes two numbers and an operation as input and prints the result.

# Input: a, b (float), operation (add/sub/mul/div)
# Output: Result of arithmetic operation

Notes:
- # Handles division by zero.
- # Uses class methods for each operation.
"""


"""
Program-2: Odd Number Series (Python)

# Prints odd numbers based on input 'a':
- # If a is odd → print first a odd numbers.
- # If a is even → print first (a-1) odd numbers.

# Input: a (integer)
# Output: Odd number series (1, 3, 5, ...)

Logic:
# Generate n odd numbers using range(1, 2*n, 2).
"""


"""
Program-3: Count Multiples (Python)

# Counts how many numbers in a list are divisible by integers 1 to 9.
Returns a dictionary with counts.

Input: List of integers
# Output: {1: count, 2: count, ..., 9: count}

Logic:
# For each i (1–9), count numbers where num % i == 0.
"""

Purpose:
# Briefly explain what this program does.

Input:
# Mention the input format or values expected.

Output:
# Describe what the program prints or returns.
